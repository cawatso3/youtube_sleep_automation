# youtube_sleep_automation

## This is an automated youtube video generator which uses stock video and audio and renders a 10 hour long video that can be played while sleeping/studying/etc...

## This is using an apple script to load the song into logic pro x and loop the audio for x amount of time

## IMOVIE is used to render the video for about 30 minutes, then for the remaining duration of the video a black screen is shown
